## Adding error handling to `Post` struct initialisation method

Since the `from_file_path` method on the `Post` struct could fail in many ways, we'll add error handling to the method. We'll write a custom `PostError` struct and implement the  `Error` trait. Since `Display` and `Debug` are  both supertraits of the Error trait, we will derive the `Debug` trait for the `PostError` and write an implementation of the `Display` trait. To begin we will just use the default debug format, we can change this later if we like.

```Rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct PostError;

impl fmt::Display for PostError {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "something went wrong")
    }
}

impl Error for PostError {}
```
