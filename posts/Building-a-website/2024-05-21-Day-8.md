# Day 8

## Displaying post titles on the website index page continued

Now we can access the posts in our handlers and pass them to the Tera context:

```Rust
#[get("/")]
async fn index(data: web::Data<AppState>) -> HttpResponse {
    let mut context = Context::new();
    context.insert("app_data", &data);
    ...
```

To display posts on the index page we can extend the `index.html` template:

```HTML
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block title %}My awesome blog{% endblock title %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
<p>I hope you find by blog interesting :)</p>
{% for post in add_data.posts %}
<p>{{ post.title }}</p>
{% end for %}
{% endblock content %}
```

Finally, to convert the post to JSON, we can use the Serde crate to serialize the `Post` and `AppDat` structs. Add `serde` to the project dependencies in the `Cargo.toml` file and include the derive feature. Additionally, add the `serde` feature to the `Chrono` crate to enable serializing of the `date` field of the `Post` struct:

```TOML
[dependencies]
...
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
```

Add the `serialize` macro to `Post` and `AppData`:

```Rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Debug, Clone, Serialize)]
pub struct Post {
...
```

```Rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
struct AppState {
...
```

## Debugging Cargo Watch

To fix the issue of Cargo Watch reloading when the html files are generated and getting stuck int an infinite loop, add the `_site` directory to the `gitignore` file:

```gitignore
/target
/_site
```

## Adding blog posts to the website

We'll change the `index.html` template and add an anchor tag to the post title with a link to the blog post URL:

```HTML
{% for post in app_d ata.posts %}
<p><a href="/{{ post.file_name }}">{{ post.title }}</a></p>
{% endfor %}
```

We'll also a few lines of CSS to`styles.css` to stop the browser adding styling to the anchor links:

```CSS
body a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: inherit;
}
```

Next, in the handlers module, we'll use Actix Web route matching to match the request's path against a URL pattern for the blog post.

Change the `blog_post` request handler to[^1]:

```Rust
#[get("/{file_name}")]
async fn blog_post(file_name: web::Path<String>) -> HttpResponse {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body(format!("You clicked on {}", &file_name))
}
```

Now you can start the server and check the links work.

[^1]: Initially the URL pattern was `/posts/{file_name` but the CSS was not rendering. Shortening the path to just `/{file_name}` fixed the issues but further investigation is required.
